                <h2>1919-1930s: Early Urban Planning and Garden City Movement</h2>
                <p>The government held an urban planning conference in Wellington in 1919 to avoid the bad environmental
                    influences marginal areas of Britain had already seen. From the meeting, there were two leading
                    solutions: either to move urban people to new towns or reform the existing cities. The general
                    assumption was that by doing proper town planning, proper towns or cities could be made healthy with
                    the contribution of social stability. The second solution, the Garden Suburbs model, was more
                    successful, with an early prototype developed in London's Hampstead. Architect Reginald Hammond
                    tried to follow this model in Durie Hill but did not complete the project.</p>

                <h2>1940s-1950s: State Housing and Suburban Sprawl</h2>
                <p>The State Housing Program arose out of the belief that town planning could significantly remake urban
                    life, especially following the ruin of two world wars. This program drove the building of new state
                    housing suburbs, notably in the Hutt Valley with Epuni, Naenae, and Taita, based on the garden city
                    concept. However, these towns were not very socially successful, as residents preferred staying at
                    home or socializing with neighbors rather than using community centers.

                    As towns expanded, urban planning faced challenges due to space and resource limitations. This often
                    led councils to rezone rural land for urban use, resulting in the loss of productive rural land and
                    high infrastructure costs. Solutions included green belts around cities and denser settlements.
                    Rapid suburban growth undermined the 1949 Auckland Development Plan's greenbelt restrictions.</p>

                <h2>1950s-1970s: Motorway Construction and Urban Renewal </h2>
                <p>By the early 1950s, urban growth and increased car ownership necessitated an extensive road network.
                    Auckland planners initially proposed suburban railways but opted for a road-based system due to the
                    city's low population density. The Auckland Harbour Bridge, opened in 1959, improved connectivity
                    between Auckland and the North Shore.

                    Urban renewal followed the impact of motorways on older neighborhoods, leading to gentrification as
                    families bought and renovated old slum houses and apartments. This revitalized certain areas but
                    displaced poorer populations to the outskirts.

                <h2>1980s-1990s: Deregulation and the Resource Management Act </h2>
                <p>In 1984, the Labour government believed that old-style regulation hindered economic growth and
                    started a deregulation policy, strengthening private property rights and easing building
                    restrictions. The Resource Management Act (RMA) of 1991 replaced the Town and Country Planning Act,
                    further relaxing regulations. This led to the replacement of historic buildings with skyscrapers and
                    the encroachment of shopping centers and business parks into residential areas, highlighting the
                    need for coordinated urban planning.

                <h2>2000 to 2017: Coordinated Growth Strategies </h2>
                <p>Since the early 2000s, local bodies have devised more policies for coordinated growth to control
                    urban development. The 1999 Auckland Regional Growth Strategy set out a 50-year vision to upgrade
                    the suburban train network and restrain sprawl through urban consolidation. There was growing focus
                    on public consultation and working with urban MƒÅori. The development of Flat Bush in South Auckland
                    in 2009 was a model of urban design and sustainability, aiming to be as car-free as possible and
                    featuring ample green and recreational areas.
